</h2>
<hr>
<p>If you don't have a GitHub account, sign up for one at <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">https://github.com</a>.</p>

<br>
<h2>2. Fork the Repository</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    - Go to the repository you want to contribute to on GitHub.<br>
    - Click the "Fork" button in the upper right-hand corner of the repository's page.<br>
    - This will create a copy (fork) of the repository under your GitHub account.
</p>

<br>
<h2>3. Clone Your Fork</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    - On your forked repository's page, click the "Code" button, and copy the URL of the repository (HTTPS or SSH).<br>
    - On your local machine, open a terminal or Git client and run the following command, replacing &lt;repository_url&gt; with the URL you copied:<br>
    <code>git clone &lt;repository_url&gt;</code>
</p>

<br>
<h2>4. Create a Branch</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    - To keep your work separate from the main branch, create a new branch. You can do this using the following Git command:<br>
    <code>git checkout -b your-branch-name</code>
</p>

<br>
<h2>5. Make Changes</h2>
<hr>
<p>Make the desired changes to the code or documentation in your local copy of the repository.</p>

<br>
<h2>6. Commit Your Changes</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    - Once your changes are complete, stage and commit them using Git:<br>
    <code>git add .<br>git commit -m "Description of your changes"</code>
</p>

<br>
<h2>7. Push Your Changes</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    - Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub:<br>
    <code>git push origin your-branch-name</code>
</p>

<br>
<h2>8. Create a Pull Request (PR)</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    - Go to your forked repository on GitHub.<br>
    - Click the "New Pull Request" button.<br>
    - Set the base repository to the original repository you want to contribute to and the base branch to the branch you want to merge your changes into.<br>
    - Set the head repository to your fork and the compare branch to your feature branch.<br>
    - Write a description of your changes.<br>
    - Click "Create Pull Request."
</p>

<br>
<h2>9. Review and Collaboration</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    - The maintainers of the original repository will review your pull request. Be prepared to make changes or answer questions during this process.<br>
    - You may need to address comments or make additional commits.
</p>

<br>
<h2>10. Merge the Pull Request</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    - Once the maintainers are satisfied with your changes, they will merge your pull request into the main repository. You'll receive a notification when this happens.
</p>

<br>
<h2>11. Keep Your Fork Updated</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    - Regularly sync your fork with the original repository to incorporate any changes made in the main branch of the original repository. You can do this by adding the original repository as a remote and pulling changes from it.
